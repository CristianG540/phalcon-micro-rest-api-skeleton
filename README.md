Getting started
--------

This is a basic API REST written on [phalconPHP framework](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon).
This project is created to help developers create a basic REST API in an easy way.

Features
--------

* Provide login with `Authorization` header with value `Basic username:password` where `username:password` **MUST BE ENCODED** with `Base64`.
* Make requests with a token after login with `Authorization` header with value `Bearer yourToken` where `yourToken` is the **signed and encrypted token** given in the response from the login process.
* Use ACL so you can have roles for users.
* Timezone ready: Work UTC time (GMT+0). Responses with iso8601 date/time format.
* Pagination ready.
* Filters.
* Easy deploy to staging and production environments.
* User profile.
* Users list.
* Cities. (Example of use: call cities API, then send name of the city when creating or updating a user.

Requirements
------------

* Apache **2**
* PHP **5.6+**
* Phalcon **3.2+**
* MySQL **5.5+**

How to install
--------------

### Using Git (recommended)

1. First you need to [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) if you havenÂ´t already.
2. Clone the project from github. Change "myproject" to you project name.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/davellanedam/phalcon-micro-api.git ./myproject
```

### Using manual download ZIP

1. Download repository
2. Uncompress to your desired directory

### Install composer dependencies after installing (Git or manual download)

```bash
cd myproject
composer install
composer update
```
### Database Configuration and Security

There are 3 files in the `/myproject/config` directory, (development, staging and production) each one is meant to be used on different environments to make your life easier on deployment.

1. Create a MySQL database with your custom name and then import `myproject.sql` (in the `/schemas` directory)
2. Open `/myproject/config/server.development.php` and setup your DEVELOPMENT (local) database connection credentials
3. Open `/myproject/config/server.staging.php` and setup your STAGING (testing server) database connection credentials
4. Open `/myproject/config/server.production.php` and setup your PRODUCTION (production server) database connection credentials

This is the structure of those 3 files, remember to change values for yours.
```php
return [
    'database' => [
        'adapter' => 'Mysql', /* Possible Values: Mysql, Postgres, Sqlite */
        'host' => 'your_ip_or_hostname',
        'username' => 'your_db_username',
        'password' => 'your_db_password',
        'dbname' => 'your_database_schema',
        'charset' => 'utf8',
    ],
    'authentication' => [
        'secret' => 'your secret key to SIGN token', // This will sign the token. (still insecure)
        'encryption_key' => 'Your ultra secret key to ENCRYPT the token', // Secure token with an ultra password
        'expirationTime' => 86400 * 7, // One week till token expires
    ]
];
```

Usage
--------------

Once everything is set up to test API routes either use Postman or any other api testing application. Remember to change the URL of the provided example Postman JSON file.

This is a REST API, so it works using the following HTTP methods:

* GET (Read): Gets a list of items, or a single item
* POST (Create): Creates an item
* PATCH (Update): Updates an item
* DELETE: Deletes an item
